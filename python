""" John, a software developer, is analyzing a sequence of numbers within a given range to calculate their digit sum. However, to simplify his task, he excludes all numbers that are palindromes (numbers that read the same backward as forward). 



Help John find the total sum of the digits of non-palindromic numbers in the range [start, end] (both inclusive).



Example:ï»¿

Input:

10

20



Output:

55



Explanation:

Range [10, 20]: Non-palindromic numbers are 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 20.

Digit sums: 1+0 + 1+2 + 1+3 + 1+4 + 1+5 + 1+6 + 1+7 + 1+8 + 2+0 = 55.

Output: 55

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer, representing the starting number of the range.

The second line of input consists of an integer, representing the ending number of the range.

Output format :
The output prints a single integer, representing the total sum of the digits of all non-palindromic numbers in the range."""


start = int(input())
end = int(input())
total_sum = 0
for num in range(start, end + 1):
    if str(num) == str(num)[::-1]:
        continue  
    total_sum += sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))
print(total_sum)
